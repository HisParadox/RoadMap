# 🚀 PCB Design Mastery Tracker

This repository is my journey from beginner to expert in PCB design, starting July 2025. All projects are done using KiCad and ordered via JLCPCB.

## 🧠 Learning Phases
- **Week 1:** Electronics fundamentals
- **Week 2:** Schematic capture & layout
- **Week 3:** Intermediate projects and DFM
- **Week 4:** Advanced topics: impedance, EMI, and differential routing

## 📁 Project Folders
Each folder includes:
- `.kicad_sch` and `.kicad_pcb` files
- Gerber exports
- BOM and assembly notes
- Screenshots and documentation
